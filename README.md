# 🎬 MavenMovies Data Analysis Project (SQL | Excel | Power BI)

## 🚀 Project Summary
This project was developed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at PW Skills. It focuses on analyzing the MavenMovies dataset — a simulated movie rental database — using SQL for data extraction, Excel for data exploration, and Power BI for visualization and reporting.

The objective is to showcase my ability to work across the data analysis pipeline: from writing complex queries to building dashboards that support business decision-making.
